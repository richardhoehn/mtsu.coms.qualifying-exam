  This Qualifying Exam research paper investigates the
  potential of improving Emotion

  Detection (ED) through real-time translation of text to
  multiple Machine Learning (ML) models

  trained in different languages. The research tries to
  address the challenges posed by the lack of

  comprehensive labeled datasets and language fragmentation
  in ED analysis.

  By extending an original language dataset with a
  translated dataset from another language

  and utilizing parallel processing with PySpark, this
  research project aims to achieve higher

  prediction rates in ED. The results presented both orally
  to the MTSUâ€™s Computational Data &

  Science Committee and within this paper demonstrate the
  effectiveness of such an approach and

  how the real-time translation technique can enhance
  emotion detection capabilities.

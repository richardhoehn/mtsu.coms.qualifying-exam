# MTSU COMS - Qualifying Exam

## Abstract

This Qualifying Exam research paper investigates the potential of improving Emotion
Detection (ED) through real-time translation of text to multiple Machine Learning (ML) models
trained in different languages. The research tries to address the challenges posed by the lack of
comprehensive labeled datasets and language fragmentation in ED analysis.

By extending an original language dataset with a translated dataset from another language
and utilizing parallel processing with PySpark, this research project aims to achieve higher
prediction rates in ED. The results presented both orally to the MTSUâ€™s Computational Data &
Science Committee and within this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of such an approach and
how the real-time translation technique can enhance emotion detection capabilities.

## Translater Information

Using Python libs to translate. I used the `deep-translator` by installing using `pip` with the following command: `pip install deep-translator`.
I used the following link: `https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-translate-text-with-python-9d203139dcf5`

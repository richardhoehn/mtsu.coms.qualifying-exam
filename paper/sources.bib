  ABSTRACT = {Emotional intelligence means an ability to understand how others are feeling so that one can adjust according to others' emotional needs. Machines with emotional intelligence must understand human emotions as well also be informative about their emotional changes. Several researchers have tried to detect emotions from speech but little work is done in the area where machines could predict emotional changes. In the proposed work we have tried to analyze the spectrum of the glottal source to predict emotional changes. The glottal source spectrum is represented as a single-frequency filtering spectrogram. Single frequency spectrogram has high resolution in the time and frequency domain simultaneously. A single-frequency filtering spectrogram is fed to EfficientNetB7 to predict time-instant emotional changes. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on two datasets IEMOCAP and RAVDESS. The proposed method shows high accuracy in comparison to other state-of-the-art techniques used for emotion prediction.},

  ABSTRACT = {We introduce XED, a multilingual fine-grained emotion dataset. The dataset consists of human-annotated Finnish (25k) and English sentences (30k), as well as projected annotations for 30 additional languages, providing new resources for many low-resource languages. We use Plutchik{'}s core emotions to annotate the dataset with the addition of neutral to create a multilabel multiclass dataset. The dataset is carefully evaluated using language-specific BERT models and SVMs to show that XED performs on par with other similar datasets and is therefore a useful tool for sentiment analysis and emotion detection.},

  ABSTRACT = {The widespread use of the Internet and the rapid dissemination of information poses the challenge of identifying the veracity of its content. Stance detection, which is the task of predicting the position of a text in regard to a specific target (e.g. claim or debate question), has been used to determine the veracity of information in tasks such as rumor classification and fake news detection. While most of the work and available datasets for stance detection address short texts snippets extracted from textual dialogues, social media platforms, or news headlines with a strong focus on the English language, there is a lack of resources targeting long texts in other languages. Our contribution in this paper is twofold. First, we present a German dataset of debate questions and news articles that is manually annotated for stance and emotion detection. Second, we leverage the dataset to tackle the supervised task of classifying the stance of a news article with regards to a debate question and provide baseline models as a reference for future work on stance detection in German news articles.},

  ABSTRACT = {Context Identifying the factors that may interfere with or sharpen the ability to recognise emotions when observing patients is a critical goal in medical education. This study addressed these issues by investigating the effects of facial appearance bias on medical students’ emotion recognition (Experiment 1) and whether such bias is modulated by the activation of relational caregiving schema (Experiment 2). Methods In Experiment 1, medical students were asked to recognise the emotions expressed by individuals differing in facial appearance (trustworthy, neutral and untrustworthy). In Experiment 2, they completed the same type of emotion recognition task after activating and anchoring themselves to the representation of the relational/human competences typical of a competent professional caregiver or after a control non-representation condition. Results In both experiments, emotion recognition was affected by facial appearance bias: medical students were less accurate and slower in their recognition of emotions displayed by untrustworthy-looking individuals than in their recognition of emotions exhibited by individuals evoking more positive inferences. In Experiment 2, the activation of care schema enhanced medical students’ emotion recognition ability regardless of facial appearance-based inferences. Conclusions Medical students’ emotion recognition is affected by appearance-based bias, but such bias may be weakened by techniques that harness medical students’ personal affective/relational and representational resources. Thus, the results provide a basis for designing curricula aimed at challenging implicit negative bias and promoting medical students’ emotion recognition ability starting in the early stages of their education.},
